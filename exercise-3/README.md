# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

#Change Directory
you can use this command to have the current directory to be cahnged to one inside the current directory by coding '''cd''' followed by the name of the directory.

- It makes it so you can only make changes to things in the directory from terminal.
- It makes it easy to tell where you should be looking and what you are working on.
- It can be used to easily change what you are going to push into git hub.
